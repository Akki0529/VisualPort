# VisualPort
This project entails a visual port model that is meant to simulate real time vehicle data in a model with objects being defined around it as vehicles and lanes being generated. This is an ongoing project in the enhanced perception program at Magna during my internship

Also has a built in car pathing and following algorithms that controls the car's motor and steering meant for real time implementation
